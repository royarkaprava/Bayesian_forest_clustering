In this repo, we provide three examples:

1. Clustering data that are from a mixture model with non-Gaussian kernels

uq_mixture_model_data_t_dist.r

2. Clustering data that are near several manifolds

uq_near_manifold.r

3. Clustering high-dimensional image data using sparse representation (Yale B photos) 

uq_high_dimesion_clustering.r
